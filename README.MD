A Note to Examineer
===================

Good time of day.

 1.	As you surely know, development by testing, aka TDD is the best way of avoiding bugs in your software and also a good documentation, where you can show use case examples of your code. This whole project is covered with unit tests. The tests consisted within the tests folder. The framework I used for unit testing is [Google Test framework](http://code.google.com/p/googletest/). Test execution files are in the same folder. If you'd like to alter the test, you shuould ./configure and make the framework sources that are placed in the lib folder, and run the makefile in tests library.
 
 2. For data structures I used the BDS queue.h macros file.
