A Note to Examineer
===================

Good time of day.

 Unfortunately my approach to the project was not appropriate to finish it in time. Curently the following parts are missing:
 1) Output to file
 2) Error handling & validations

 The project is not running correctly. I tried to approach it with the best practicies I know (like Test Driven Development, correct source control with Git), but might have spent way too much time on it, and still couldn't get the result I wanted. Anyway, this course had a great value to me for understanding low level programming, the importance of the tools I have in modern computer languages (OOP, exceptions, memory management). I would like to appologize for your hard work of checking not running, messy code.

 Thank you,
 Yevgeniy.
